# GemToasterAmp
 9v to 12v Battery Powered Amp

 _LM386 Based power amp with JFET Preamp_

 - Quality of sound highly dependent on speaker & cab combo.

 ### JFET Selection
 
 _I thought there were some notes on this but I can't find them, the only other thing I had read says "Anything Goes". They used cheapo out of spec parts and they worked._
 
### Other Parts slection

Some parts can be more difficult to find or I just didnt have them in stock for my test build, so these are the values I used in my *working* build:
 
 3.9k Resistors - 15k in parallel with 5.1k
 4.3k Resistors - 15k in  parallel  with 6.2k
 
 
470n Capacitor - 390n Could put an additional 100n in parallel to get closer to marked value

15n Capacitor - 22n
